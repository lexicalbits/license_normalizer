A tool born of necessity.

First, install https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-license-crawler

Next, run it on all of your projects/services and output JSON:

  npm-license-crawler --json ./{project_name}.json

Finally, edit index.js, replace fe.js and be.js with the outputs, and:

  node index.js > licenses.txt

You'll have to track down some UNKNOWNs by hand, I'm afraid.

Future TODO, if there's ever a need/interest:

* Sniff for json files in the CWD instead of relying on manual entry
* Add a real CLI
* Customizable output
* Hunt down licenses not added to package.json by looking for some files in github
  (LICENSE, License, License.txt, LICENCE-MIT, etc.)
* Hunt down licenses in README but not in LICENCE
* Nag package owners to fix their code and normalize their values
